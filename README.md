This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project also uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) to perform server-side rendering. As a result, Next.js is also responsible
for managing assets, processing css, and routing between components.
